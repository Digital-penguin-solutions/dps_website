                    <p>1. Digitalis starts working on a project upon receipt of a down payment. Unless otherwise
                        specified in writing, the client is charged the remaining balance upon completion of the
                        project. Websites are made live upon completion of the project, when all payments are cleared.
                        If applicable, hosting and domain name registration fees must be paid every month.</p>

                    <p>2. Additional services come at additional fees, on a fee for service basis or on an hourly rate.
                        If clients require additional services, the correspondent fee is added to their invoice and they
                        are charged accordingly.</p>

                    <p>Delays in project completion may occur when:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Delays in project completion may occur when:</li>
                        <li>The client requests further changes in the design, structure, or content of the project</li>
                        <li>The client purchases an additional service related to the project</li>
                        <li>There is a delay in the receipt of any materials form the client</li>
                        <li>Time frame estimates are approximate only and are subject to change at any time at Digitalis
                            discretion. At any time, and at its whole discretion, may decide to put
                            a project on hold.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>4. All of our services are 100% satisfaction guaranteed. We don’t stop working until our clients
                        are completely satisfied with their solution. That is our commitment. However, Digitlais will
                        under no circumstances be held responsible to satisfy unreasonable expectations or request Big
                        Drop ‘s discretion to decide whether or not a request or an expectation is reasonable or lies
                        within the scope of offer of services to its client. As an example, if the client purchases a
                        certain service, but in order to be fully satisfied, Digitlais judges that an additional
                        service is necessary, then it is no longer Digitlais’s responsibility or commitment to
                        satisfy the client. In other words, Digitlais guarantees 100% satisfaction within the
                        framework of its original agreement with the client, according to Digitlais’s
                        understanding.</p>

                    <p>5. Services or part of services (i.e. elements of a project) that have been approved by the
                        client are considered as services with which the client is 100% satisfied. Any further work on
                        these services (elements of the project) will be invoiced accordingly.</p>

                    <p>6. Unless clearly specified otherwise, all project statuses are set as “completed” after a 3
                        month period has passed (calculated from the first payment date).This means no more work will be
                        done on that project and no service will be provided. This doesn’t apply to hosting and domain
                        name registration services, which are provided independently of the project status, and only
                        according to the client’s payments.</p>

                    <p>7. If client is not satisfied with Digitlais Services, client can ask for a refund on any
                        unused monies. Digitlais will be happy to exercise a refund, after doing it on review.</p>

                            it designs and/or hosts. Digitlais has no control over any information, materials, or

                        <li>Because of the nature of web design and programming work, websites always appear differently
                            on different computers. Screen resolution, operating system, and browsing software are just
                            a few examples of variables that may affect the way a website looks. The client must be
                            aware of these possible variations and Digitlais will not be held responsible for them.
